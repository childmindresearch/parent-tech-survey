He doesn't yet text, message or call friends or use any messaging apps. he does have a Nintendo switch and we have just in the past few months started allowing him to pay Fortnite and chatting with a few kids he knows in person from school. he's in the living room so we can hear the conversations. I'm not crazy about it because of the level of addiction I'm seeing already- the meltdowns when he has to get off. we've stayed firm and implementing lots of forced breaks, even sometimes for a few days. Both my kids have struggled socially and with some varying degrees of bullying. So I'm seeing him spending this time online in the game, talking and joking with his friends and it's just very hard to rip that away from him, even if I do have concerns about kids online doing anything. believe it or not, my 12 yo oldest is even further behind socially, so to see my 10 year old so happy and chatting with his friends, who are kids we know from school, like a normal kid, it like gives me some relief, that maybe this kid will find his people and be ok. But then also, aside from the obsession, I'm also watching my older one hurt more that he doesn't have friends to play with. so it's all had. To determine age-appropriateness, I look to mature themes, I don't really allow realistic violent games at home yet(I know he see them on playdates with kids who have older siblings.,) I don't get too   concerned about language. I haven't allowed opened chatting with people we didn't know in Roblox or Fortnite. he still only has access to YouTube kids, although I will let him watch regular YouTube on the big TV in living room.

Content Themes: Evaluate the themes present in the content, such as violence, sexual content, substance use, or mature language. Content that includes these themes may not be suitable for younger audiences.    2. Developmental Stage: Consider the child's cognitive and emotional development. Younger children may not have the maturity to process complex or sensitive topics, while older children might be able to handle more nuanced discussions.    3. Cultural and Family Values: Take into account your family's values and cultural background. What might be acceptable in one family or culture may not be in another, so it's essential to align content with your own beliefs.    4. Educational Value: Assess whether the content has educational benefits. Content that promotes learning or positive social skills can be more appropriate, even if it touches on challenging subjects.    5. Peer Influence: Consider what content is being consumed by peers, as social dynamics can affect a child's interest and understanding of certain topics.",

Educational Value: Considering if the content provides educational benefits or promotes positive learning experiences.    Emotional Impact: Assessing whether the content could be emotionally distressing or too intense for the child's maturity level.    Role Models and Behavior: Evaluating the behaviors and values depicted by characters to ensure they align with the family's values and promote positive role models.    Peer Influence: Reflecting on what other children of the same age are engaging with and what is culturally appropriate among peers.    Parental Controls and Ratings: Using parental guidelines, age ratings, and reviews from trusted sources like Common Sense Media or other parenting resources.",

He doesn't yet text, message or call friends or use any messaging apps. he does have a Nintendo switch and we have just in the past few months started allowing him to pay Fortnite and chatting with a few kids he knows in person from school. he's in the living room so we can hear the conversations. I'm not crazy about it because of the level of addiction I'm seeing already- the meltdowns when he has to get off. we've stayed firm and implementing lots of forced breaks, even sometimes for a few days. Both my kids have struggled socially and with some varying degrees of bullying. So I'm seeing him spending this time online in the game, talking and joking with his friends and it's just very hard to rip that away from him, even if I do have concerns about kids online doing anything. believe it or not, my 12 yo oldest is even further behind socially, so to see my 10 year old so happy and chatting with his friends, who are kids we know from school, like a normal kid, it like gives me some relief, that maybe this kid will find his people and be ok. But then also, aside from the obsession, I'm also watching my older one hurt more that he doesn't have friends to play with. so it's all had. To determine age-appropriateness, I look to mature themes, I don't really allow realistic violent games at home yet(I know he see them on playdates with kids who have older siblings.,) I don't get too   concerned about language. I haven't allowed opened chatting with people we didn't know in Roblox or Fortnite. he still only has access to YouTube kids, although I will let him watch regular YouTube on the big TV in living room. I really don't like regular YouTube and it's in really small doses, and I regularly hear some innuendo for sex or substance abuse, or other adult themes, and sometimes when the bad language is just too constant and over the top",

Content Themes: Evaluate the themes present in the content, such as violence, sexual content, substance use, or mature language. Content that includes these themes may not be suitable for younger audiences.    2. Developmental Stage: Consider the child's cognitive and emotional development. Younger children may not have the maturity to process complex or sensitive topics, while older children might be able to handle more nuanced discussions.    3. Cultural and Family Values: Take into account your family's values and cultural background. What might be acceptable in one family or culture may not be in another, so it's essential to align content with your own beliefs.    4. Educational Value: Assess whether the content has educational benefits. Content that promotes learning or positive social skills can be more appropriate, even if it touches on challenging subjects.    5. Peer Influence: Consider what content is being consumed by peers, as social dynamics can affect a child's interest and understanding of certain topics.",

While I don't want to be overly influenced by peers, it's helpful to be aware of what's popular and what's generally deemed appropriate for their age.    7. **Parental Controls and Settings:** I use tools like parental controls and age ratings on platforms to further guide my decisions, making sure the content aligns with my family's standards.

Instead of determining that stuff was inappropriate, we looked to make sure he was understanding how humans work from a young age.  We got him a times subscription in 3rd grade and then would talk about the WHY with the articles he brought to our attention.

He doesn't yet text, message or call friends or use any messaging apps. he does have a Nintendo switch and we have just in the past few months started allowing him to pay Fortnite and chatting with a few kids he knows in person from school. he's in the living room so we can hear the conversations. I'm not crazy about it because of the level of addiction I'm seeing already- the meltdowns when he has to get off. we've stayed firm and implementing lots of forced breaks, even sometimes for a few days. Both my kids have struggled socially and with some varying degrees of bullying. So I'm seeing him spending this time online in the game, talking and joking with his friends and it's just very hard to rip that away from him, even if I do have concerns about kids online doing anything. believe it or not, my 12 yo oldest is even further behind socially, so to see my 10 year old so happy and chatting with his friends, who are kids we know from school, like a normal kid, it like gives me some relief, that maybe this kid will find his people and be ok. But then also, aside from the obsession, I'm also watching my older one hurt more that he doesn't have friends to play with. so it's all had. To determine age-appropriateness, I look to mature themes, I don't really allow realistic violent games at home yet(I know he see them on playdates with kids who have older siblings.,) I don't get too   concerned about language. I haven't allowed opened chatting with people we didn't know in Roblox or Fortnite. he still only has access to YouTube kids, although I will let him watch regular YouTube on the big TV in living room. I really don't like regular YouTube and it's in really small doses, and I regularly hear some innuendo for sex or substance abuse, or other adult themes, and sometimes when the bad language is just too constant and over the top",

          "When determining if content is \"age-appropriate\" for a child, several factors can be considered:    1. Content Themes: Evaluate the themes present in the content, such as violence, sexual content, substance use, or mature language. Content that includes these themes may not be suitable for younger audiences.    2. Developmental Stage: Consider the child's cognitive and emotional development. Younger children may not have the maturity to process complex or sensitive topics, while older children might be able to handle more nuanced discussions.    3. Cultural and Family Values: Take into account your family's values and cultural background. What might be acceptable in one family or culture may not be in another, so it's essential to align content with your own beliefs.    4. Educational Value: Assess whether the content has educational benefits. Content that promotes learning or positive social skills can be more appropriate, even if it touches on challenging subjects.    5. Peer Influence: Consider what content is being consumed by peers, as social dynamics can affect a child's interest and understanding of certain topics.",

He doesn't yet text, message or call friends or use any messaging apps. he does have a Nintendo switch and we have just in the past few months started allowing him to pay Fortnite and chatting with a few kids he knows in person from school. he's in the living room so we can hear the conversations. I'm not crazy about it because of the level of addiction I'm seeing already- the meltdowns when he has to get off. we've stayed firm and implementing lots of forced breaks, even sometimes for a few days. Both my kids have struggled socially and with some varying degrees of bullying. So I'm seeing him spending this time online in the game, talking and joking with his friends and it's just very hard to rip that away from him, even if I do have concerns about kids online doing anything. believe it or not, my 12 yo oldest is even further behind socially, so to see my 10 year old so happy and chatting with his friends, who are kids we know from school, like a normal kid, it like gives me some relief, that maybe this kid will find his people and be ok. But then also, aside from the obsession, I'm also watching my older one hurt more that he doesn't have friends to play with. so it's all had. To determine age-appropriateness, I look to mature themes, I don't really allow realistic violent games at home yet(I know he see them on playdates with kids who have older siblings.,) I don't get too   concerned about language. I haven't allowed opened chatting with people we didn't know in Roblox or Fortnite. he still only has access to YouTube kids, although I will let him watch regular YouTube on the big TV in living room. I really don't like regular YouTube and it's in really small doses, and I regularly hear some innuendo for sex or substance abuse, or other adult themes, and sometimes when the bad language is just too constant and over the top",

Content Themes: Evaluate the themes present in the content, such as violence, sexual content, substance use, or mature language. Content that includes these themes may not be suitable for younger audiences.    2. Developmental Stage: Consider the child's cognitive and emotional development. Younger children may not have the maturity to process complex or sensitive topics, while older children might be able to handle more nuanced discussions.    3. Cultural and Family Values: Take into account your family's values and cultural background. What might be acceptable in one family or culture may not be in another, so it's essential to align content with your own beliefs.    4. Educational Value: Assess whether the content has educational benefits. Content that promotes learning or positive social skills can be more appropriate, even if it touches on challenging subjects.    5. Peer Influence: Consider what content is being consumed by peers, as social dynamics can affect a child's interest and understanding of certain topics.",

Is it likely to cause fear, confusion, or stress, or will it be uplifting and educational?    3. **Language and Tone:** I assess whether the language used is suitable for my child's age. Is the language simple, clear, and respectful, or does it include inappropriate words or phrases?    4. **Visual Content:** Are the visuals (such as images or videos) suitable? I check for violence, nudity, or anything that might be unsettling or confusing for my child.    5. **Developmental Appropriateness:** I consider whether the content aligns with my child's cognitive, emotional, and social development stage. Is the content challenging enough to stimulate growth, or is it too advanced or too simple?    6. **Peer Influence and Trends:** I also take into account what other children in their age group are watching or engaging with. While I don't want to be overly influenced by peers, it's helpful to be aware of what's popular and what's generally deemed appropriate for their age.    7. **Parental Controls and Settings:** I use tools like parental controls and age ratings on platforms to further guide my decisions, making sure the content aligns with my family's standards.
